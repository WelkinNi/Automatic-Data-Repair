When La Trobe first opened in 1967 its sports clubs used the University of Melbourne as a benchmark to emulate. One outcome of this was the creation of the La Trobe University Reds and the La Trobe University Blacks in 1968, which was based on the University Blues and the University Blacks at Melbourne.|group=Note
