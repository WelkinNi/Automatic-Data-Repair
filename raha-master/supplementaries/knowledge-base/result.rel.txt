However, the Thai argue that since the French didn't proceed to bombard their army along the coast, they had had successfully repelled the attack (albeit at a heavy cost), thus giving them a strategic victory. Even though the French force chose to not immediately join in the land conflict, they were certainly clear to do so. Before they could, the Japanese intervened, fearing that the war would turn sour for their Thai allies. In the end, the French were forced to sign a treaty that respected Thai territorial claims. This sudden end to the war stopped Thai incursion into Indochina, but also cut short the French's attempt to mount a full counter-attack.|group=Note\n*Japanese diplomatic intervention resulting in ceasefire
