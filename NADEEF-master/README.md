### What is NADEEF?

NADEEF (or ''clean'' in Arabic, نظيف) is a generalized data cleaning system developed by the data analytic group at [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://da.qcri.org). 

### See it in Action

Launch NADEEF using command 
```
    Usage: nadeef.sh [OPTIONS]
    Options are:
        console : start the NADEEF console.
        dashboard : start the NADEEF dashboard.
```

**A demo page can be accessed via [here](http://nadeef.da.qcridemos.org/).**

More details on the instructions can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/daqcri/NADEEF/wiki/User-Guide).

### Goals of NADEEF

**Being a commodity data cleaning system, NADEEF aims to be extensible, generic and easy-to-deploy.**

Most existing data cleaning methods and systems, either in industry or academia,
employ different types of data quality rules in isolation, each time a new data cleaning problem arises or
a new type of rules is considered, practitioners either build a new system from scratch or go through a painful
process of customizing an existing tool. The NADEEF team designed a new data cleaning system that distinguishes
between a programming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility.
